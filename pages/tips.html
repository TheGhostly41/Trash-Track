            <h2> Tip 1: Choose products with minimal or recyclable packaging to reduce waste from the start. </h2>
            <h2> Tip 2: Turn food scraps (like fruit and vegetable peels) and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil instead of sending them to the landfill. </h2>
            <h2> Tip 3: Check your local municipality's guidelinesâ€”not all plastics, glass, or paper are accepted. </h2>
            <h2> Tip 4: Ensure all loose trash is securely bagged and tied to prevent litter and keep bins clean. </h2>
            <h2> Tip 5: Swap disposable water bottles and coffee cups for reusable ones. </h2>
